== Intro
* This module joins prototype DataModel which should be implemented in the rest modules. And  the skeleton (set of interfaces).
* The interfaces will be used in ingress, business-logic and persistence modules. Facade interfaces should be implemented in particular modules and joined together in application module.

== Module parts

=== Common Data Model

Common Used Data Model (prototypes of model's entities)
