== Intro
* The module joins prototype DataModel which should be implemented in the rest modules. +
And  the layers' skeletons (set of interfaces).
* The interfaces will be used in ingress, business-logic and persistence modules. +
Facades should be implemented in particular modules and joined together in main application module.
